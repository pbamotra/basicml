## New books to read and craft. Yes!
- [Karakuri: How to Make Mechanical Paper Models That Move](https://www.amazon.com/Karakuri-Make-Mechanical-Paper-Models/dp/0312566697/)
    - I was always fascinated about mechanisms and workings of toys. This looks to be the best way rediscover that childhood curiosity. Paper toys! Ahoy.
- [Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents](https://www.amazon.com/Caste-Origins-Discontents-Isabel-Wilkerson/dp/0593230256/)
    - Last year, I came across [BOTY](https://www.bookofthemonth.com/) and they have pretty good collection of selected books. I was able to get this book for a pretty good $5.99. BOTY is worth it if you  read fiction. So, I unsubscribed.
    - To connect the dots, I'm always reminded of this specific thing that Yuval Noah Harari talks in his magnum opus _Sapiens_ that humans inherently look the world in terms of you and me, superior vs inferior, and likewise. Pressing the same nerve, Yuval doesn't shy away from being a little sarcastic about human naming their species - Homo sapiens a.k.a. The wise man. Caste / Social division to me is just another manifestation of this selfish gene. 
- [Invent and Wander: The Collected Writings of Jeff Bezos](https://www.amazon.com/Invent-Wander-Collected-Writings-Introduction/dp/1647820715/)
    - Well, I am a fan of Jeff Bezos' writings and interviews. This book binds together some of his good pieces. Looking forward to read this as I order a pair of running [socks](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072DWHQQS/) from Amazon.

## Trying a few new culinary things
- [Longjing green tea](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08M92BSJT/)
    - I was actually looking for some matcha to add to my smoothies. But, ended up buying this for a change.
- [Califia Farms Mocha Cold Brew](https://www.amazon.com/Califia-Farms-Coffee-Almondmilk-Non-GMO/dp/B00UUSXBQ2/)
    - I'm not a big coffee fan, but this stuff is so delicious
    - Made my banana shakes a little more interesting üçå
- [Oreo Cookie Popcorn](https://www.amazon.com/Oreo-Cookie-Popcorn-Pieces-5-25oz/dp/B08SJHM7WD)
    - Well, what the heck
    - Too sugary to enjoy but still 3/5 good.

## Went for my first run in a loooooong while üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- I'm using Nike Run club app and I must say it's good for beginners.
    - Run to finish. Keep your pace slow, and don't look at the stopwatch.
    - I didn't expect that running would be so much more taxing than running on my indoor cycle. These are two VERY different things. 
    - To find the right shoe, I went to Dick's Sporting Goods for a very basic gait analysis. Found out that I've a low arch and chose a pair.
    - I loved running. Looking forward to many more strides.
