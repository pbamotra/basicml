I went to Nashville, Tennessee. For some reason because of [Jack Daniels](https://www.jackdaniels.com/en-us/visit-distillery), I had a notion of Nashville as city with Texan vibes with cowboy hats. Lol! But, it's a much beautiful city. Loved the downtown vibes, [state museum](https://tnmuseum.org/), and (fortunately) [Kara Walker](http://www.karawalkerstudio.com/) art exhibit at [Fritz art museum](https://fristartmuseum.org/). Such moving pieces of black history. It changes a part of you. Loved it.

## Restaurants I tried in Nashville, TN
- [Nashville bartaco](https://bartaco.com/location/nashville-tn/) - Great vibes, decent food
- [Inchin's bamboo garden](https://bamboo-gardens.com/nashville-tn/) - I guess the most okay indo-chinese food in the US. Pretty standard stuff.
- [Maggiano's Little Italy](https://www.maggianos.com/) - Again, great vibes, good food
- [Chaatable](https://chaatablenashville.com/) - Below average food served in amazing ambience
