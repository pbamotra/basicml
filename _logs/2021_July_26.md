## Respite from heat and some Go-karting
It's been a pleasant weekend after a long and [hot week](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/07/30/pacific-northwest-heat-wave-drought/). Saturday saw some drizzle and cloudy noon and we went for an awesome outing at [PGP Motorsports Park](https://pacificgp.com/) in Kent, WA. Besides, we also went for a quick peek at drag races at [Pacific raceways](https://pacificraceways.com/schedule/). Interestingly, a lot of big races are lined up at Pacific raceways in coming months. Looking forward to making to one.
