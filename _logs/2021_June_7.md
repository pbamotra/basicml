## Speed running and longer distances üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- I've been running on concrete roads for almost 2 weeks now
- Since, I've a low arch, I switched from [Hoka One One Clifton 8](https://www.hokaoneone.com/clifton-8/) to [Brooks Adrenaline GTS 21](https://www.brooksrunning.com/en_us/adrenaline-gts-21-mens-running-shoes/110349.html) shoes. Brooks has much more stability and I feel lighter running with it.
- In the past week, I tried interval running and ran my first 4+ miles near [Marymoor Park](https://kingcounty.gov/services/parks-recreation/parks/parks-and-natural-lands/popular-parks/marymoor.aspx).

## Quote I've been pondering about
- Keep your word, always. Especially, to yourself.
- More than the first sentence, the second one hit me pretty hard.

## Learning
- [UC Berkeley CS182 - Deep learning](https://cs182sp21.github.io/) by Sergey Levine
    - I'm going through couple of refresher DL courses and I like Prof. Levine's way of teaching.
- [Stanford CS106L - Standard C++ Programming](hhttp://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106l/lectures.html) by Ethan Chi
    - Just exploring my love hate relationship with C++
    - Neat lecture slides
- [Brag document](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/#template) by [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca)
    - I have a new manager. I'm thinking of discussing this approach with her.
    - Looking forward to mentoring two new interns. Yay.
