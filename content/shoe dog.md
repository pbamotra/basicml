## Notes
- [PHIL 1964, Pg 63] The world is without beauty when you lose
- [PHIL 1964, Pg 65] There were many ways down Mount Fuji, according to my guidebook, but only one way up
- [SARAH 1964, Pg 69] Happiness is a how, not a what
- [PHIL 1968, Pg 117] I wanted to focus constantly on the one task that really mattered. If my life was to be all work and no play, I wanted my work to be play
- [PHIL/PRE 1972 Pg 210] No matter the sport - no matter the human endeavour, really — total effort will win people’s hearts
- [PHIL 1975, Pg 266] Don’t go to sleep one night. What you most want will come to you then
- [PRE 1975, Pg 278] Somebody may beat me — but they’re going to have to bleed to do it
- [A Harvard professor 1976, Pg 298] Normally, if one manager at a company can think tactically and strategically, that company has a good future
- [PHIL 1976, Pg 302] Don’t tell people how to do things, tell them what to do and let them surprise you with their results
- [Nike Ad 1977, Pg 313] Beating the competition is relatively easy. Beating yourself is a never-ending commitment 
- [PHIL 1978, Pg 327] But instead of cherishing how far we’d come, I saw only how far we had to go
- [PHIL/The bucket list movie Night, Pg 370] You measure yourself by the people who measure themselves by you
- [PHIL Night, Pg 374] Change never comes as fast as we want it
- [PHIL Night, Pg 380] I’d tell men and women in their mid twenties not to settle for a job or a profession or even a career. Seek a calling. Even if you don’t know what that means, seek it. If you’re following your calling, the fatigue will be easier to bear, the disappointments will be fuel, the highs will be like nothing like you’ve ever felt.
- [PHIL Night, Pg 381] Sometimes knowing when to give ups when to try something else, is genius. Giving up doesn’t mean stopping. Don’t ever stop.
